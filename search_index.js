In Landau’s paradigm, phases (or orders) are described by symmetry. It turns out that there is a new kind of order beyond the paradigm, which is named topological order . The absence of symmetry doesn't imply topological orders are trivial or messy; on the contrary, they exhibit numerous extremely intriguing features.","category":"page"},{"location":"Research Interests/","page":"Research Interests","title":"Research Interests","text":"One interesting feature is the existence of topological excitations (anyons). They cannot be created or annihilated by local operators; moreover, their properties are invariant under local perturbations (as long as they don't break the energy gap). This might be what 'topological' means.","category":"page"},{"location":"Research Interests/","page":"Research Interests","title":"Research Interests","text":"Anyons in some topological orders carry exotic nonabelian statistics, that is, exchanging (braiding) anyons are nontrivial unitary operations rather than just phase factors as in the case of bosons or fermions. Mathematically, the excitations form an elegant structure called unitary modular tensor category.

In some sense, normal phases including superfluids and Bose-Einstein condenses are classical because the quantum states are product states. In contrast, topological orders are not in product states due to long-range entanglement.

We can determine whether a certain quantum state is entangled; we may even quantify entanglement by entanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy. But this description seems to be an oversimplification. It's like describing linear operators only by determinants, ignoring other delicate structures.

Specifically, we take the Hilbert space of anyon fusions to be the logical space and take braidings to be quantum operations.

The topological feature ensures robustness against errors; it is also shown that universal quantum computation can be effectively performed by braiding anyons (arxiv:quant-ph/0001108) Furthermore, the scheme is easily scalable.
